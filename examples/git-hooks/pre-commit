# beads (beads) pre-commit hook
#
# This hook ensures that any pending beads issue changes are flushed to
# .beads/issues.jsonl before the commit is created, preventing the
# race condition where daemon auto-flush fires after the commit.
#
# Installation:
#   cp examples/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or use the install script:
#   examples/git-hooks/install.sh

# Check if beads is available
if ! command -v beads >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Warning: beads command not found, skipping pre-commit flush" >&2
    exit 0
fi

# Check if we're in a beads workspace
if [ ! -d .beads ]; then
    # Not a beads workspace, nothing to do
    exit 0
fi

# Flush pending changes to JSONL
# Use --flush-only to skip git operations (we're already in a git hook)
# Suppress output unless there's an error
if ! beads sync --flush-only >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Error: Failed to flush beads changes to JSONL" >&2
    echo "Run 'beads sync --flush-only' manually to diagnose" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# If the JSONL file was modified, stage it
if [ -f .beads/issues.jsonl ]; then
    git add .beads/issues.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi

exit 0
